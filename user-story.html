        <p>As a user, Matthew appreciates the entire functionality of PC Part Picker and has come to learn a lot about pc parts. He is a new and learning hardware enthusiast who acquired a job solely to be able to build a computer.
            Although he is satisfied about most facets of the site, he wishes that he could connect with friends from other social media sites that also use pc part picker and take a look at the builds they've put together and what parts they've favorited.</p>
